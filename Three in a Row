//Title: Three in a Row
//Date: 3/25/2016
//Purpose:  Three in a Row is a game you play against the computer.  You and the computer pick a number between 1 and 100.
//To get the other two numbers in the sequence, you add 1 to the previous number to get the next number.
//For example, if you choose the number 10, then your sequence is 10, 11, 12.
//You and the computer take turn guessing one of the numbers in the opponent's sequence.
//The first player to find all three numbers in their opponent's sequence wins the game.

//Include the input/output library.
#include<iostream>

//These libraries are good for the computer to pick the random numbers.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>
using namespace std;
